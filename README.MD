Mostly a private repo, this won't help you much. I may eventually port this for public use once it matures a bit. 

Dependencies:

1. MySQL-Connector for Python. Follow the answer here for installation http://stackoverflow.com/questions/31748278/how-do-you-install-mysql-connector-python-development-version-through-pip

INSTALLATION

sensors:

1. Configure sensors (add info on how)
2. Tweak output (need to standardize this still)
...

poolstats:

1. Configure api_key (get it from the MPOS pool you're using)

marketdata:

1. None, should work out of the box. Public API's only


Final Notes:

1. Set up a MySQL Backup so you don't lose your historical data in the event of a serious failure!
